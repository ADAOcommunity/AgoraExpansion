# agora-expansion

The Agora Expansion validators are meant to serve as a standalone set of validators (as opposed to a library) which provide functionality for users to create a fungible token which may be used as a governance token to participate in the usage of Agora (https://github.com/Liqwid-Labs/Agora) with novel structures of governance. NFTs, or multiple fungible tokens may be used together to calculate voting power based on the configuration used.
